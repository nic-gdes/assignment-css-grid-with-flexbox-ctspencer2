        <p class="heading"><em>NOW more than ever</em>
        </p><p class="text"><em>If there was ever a time when people need a realtor, it is now!!&nbsp; </em></p>
        <p class="text">At this crucial time, in a  changing 
  market, people need a hard working, honest, and knowledgeable realtor  
  to help them through this challenging market.&nbsp;  At a time when 
  numerous realtors are deciding to try other careers, is  the time when 
  Sheri Tilton just digs in her heels and works even harder to  fulfill 
  her client's needs and expectations.&nbsp;  She is firmly committed to 
  her career in Real Estate, and will continue  to be there to listen 
  carefully to you, and will definitely &#8220;<strong><em>Go  the Extra Mile</em></strong>&#8221; to serve your Real Estate needs.&nbsp; Her professionalism and expertise are the  difference you cannot afford to be without.<br>
          <br>
          Sheri�s background work history  and extreme work ethics have 
  been a huge advantage and a real benefit for her  clients.&nbsp; With 
  her 6 years of being a  builder, along with working with her husband in 
  excavation, her extensive  background in both building and excavation 
  has contributed towards her  knowledge and expertise in her real estate 
  career.&nbsp; She has physically been down in the ditches  installing 
  numerous drain fields, septic systems, and sewer lines.&nbsp; She can 
  point out the difference of an older  3 tab roof verses an updated 
  architectural roof, explain the difference between  an active and 
  passive radon system, and can try to determine on how difficult  it may 
  be to add that 3rd bathroom in the basement depending on the  location 
  of the plumbing and where the elevation of the septic or sewer line is  
  entering the home if it is even visible.&nbsp;  She&nbsp; will 
  normally&nbsp; check out the electrical panel boxes to see  if they are a
   Federal Pacific brand, for they have been recalled, along with  the era
   of when the LP siding had the class action suit.<br>
          <br>
          The excavation background has  been a huge benefit for her 
  clients that are looking at raw land with the dream  of building their 
  own home.&nbsp; She has a  general knowledge of the different types of 
  soil, with the potential types of  septic systems they could be up 
  against.&nbsp;  She�s always looking for the perfect slope to provide 
  the desirable  daylight walk-out basement, and points out to her clients
   on where the sun  rises and sets, so they can determine on how they may
   want to design their  home.&nbsp; Evening shade is perfect for those  
  summer BBQ�s!<br>
          <br>
          With Sheri also having a long  lasting love for horses since she
   was a small girl, she has a tremendous amount  of knowledge in the 
  equestrian properties.&nbsp;  She owns a beautiful black quarter horse 
  that she is very proud to say has been used in a therapeutic riding 
  program for handicapped children and  adults.&nbsp; She also has a 
  gorgeous  Appaloosa Mule in which she has shown and won against the 
  horses.&nbsp; The many years of horse ownership is also a  large benefit
   for her equestrian clients.<br>
          <br>
          If you are currently in the  market for an existing home, 
  looking to build a new home, or are interested in  an equestrian 
  property, you need to rely on Sheri Tilton�s expertise.&nbsp; She will 
  definitely <strong><em>&#8220;Go the Extra Mile&#8221; </em></strong>for  you.&nbsp;
   That is why Sheri Tilton is blessed  with at least 90% of her business 
  coming from referrals, and she will always strive to  fulfill her
